## If you using `homebridge-config-ui-x`

It's easy to grant access, go to plugin setting, select `Login with LG Account (plain username/password)` if you using LG account or select `Login with other methods` if you using 3rd-party like Google Account, Apple ID, Facebook ...

## if you using Hoobs and LG account

Put your `username` and `password` to plugin setting and it's done.

## if you using Hoobs and logged by Google account or Apple ID or Facebook account

I RECOMMENDED you to create new LG account (not logged by 3rd-party provider) and migrate all device to new account, it's fastest

or you can install `homebridge-config-ui-x` to use Custom UI feature
